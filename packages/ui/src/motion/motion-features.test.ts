/**
 * Guard for the `m` / `LazyMotion` split (VITA-1238).
 *
 * `m.*` renders perfectly well without a `LazyMotion` ancestor — it just never
 * animates. There is no type error, no console warning, and no failing render
 * test, so a component that loses its boundary degrades silently and only
 * shows up as "the panel stopped sliding" in manual QA. Since each component
 * carries its own boundary rather than relying on a host provider, the
 * invariant is checkable statically: importing `m` obliges you to import
 * `MotionFeatures`.
 *
 * The reverse pairing matters just as much. Reintroducing `motion.*` anywhere
 * in this package silently re-bundles Framer Motion's whole feature set —
 * roughly 13 kB gzipped — into every host that renders it, which is what
 * pushed the extension's side-panel chunk to 467 bytes under its ceiling.
 *
 * `MotionDragFeatures` counts as a boundary too: `domAnimation` has no drag,
 * so a dragging component needs the `domMax` boundary instead. It is a
 * separate module precisely so only that component's chunk pays for it.
 *
 * Sources are read through `import.meta.glob` rather than `node:fs` because
 * this package typechecks against the DOM lib only and has no `@types/node`.
